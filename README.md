This is a template for a fullstack application using React, Node.js, Spring, Spring Boot, MySQL Application. It is a simple application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes. The application is split into two parts: the client and the server. The client is a React application that allows users to interact with the application. The server is a Spring Boot application that handles requests from the client and interacts with the database.
